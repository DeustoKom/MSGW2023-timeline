2014,,,,2015,,,,,Back to LEB,"<p>After three seasons as coach, Sito Alonso leaves GBC for Bilbao Basket. The club then signed the Catalan Jaume Ponsarnau. Several players from the previous season left as well, among others Jason Robinson, Raulzinho Neto, Jon Cortaberria or Javi Salgado.

The season started badly, with 5 consecutive defeats. On matchday 6 they won their first match against MoraBanc Andorra. Since then, the team won several victories that allow it to have a good margin for relegation.

However, starting on matchday 25, the team went back into a horrible streak, winning only 1 of the 10 remaining games. Despite staying out of relegation for much of the season and having key matches to seal their permanence, the team reaches the last day with options to drop. To save himself, he depended on himself, and his direct rival, Manresa, had to win on the court of the regular league champion, Real Madrid, who had not lost a home game that season in the league. However, the miracle happened. The GBC lost their game, and Manresa did the unthinkable and won at the home of undefeated local Real Madrid, condemning Gipuzkoa Basket to the third relegation in its history.</p>",https://www.diariovasco.com/20120626/deportes/gipuzkoa-basket/sito-alonso-rompe-contraro-201206262207.html,Diario Vasco,,,,,,GREY
2020,,,,,,,,,Pandemic year,"<p>To start another season in the second state competition, the Argentine Marcelo Nicola was entrusted with the position of coach, and the squad was revolutionized again: Xabi Oroz was the only player who continued, while Johnny Dee, Alex Murphy, Lazar Mutić, Karamo Jawara, Mikel Motos, Mikel Úriz, Reed Timmer, Julen Olaizola, Davis Rozitis, Biram Faye and Adam Sollazzo.

The team soon began to demonstrate its potential, especially defensively, and remained at the top along with Carramimbre CBC Valladolid, a team that would win the Princess Cup 55-62 on February 4, 2020, thus becoming the first team that would win this title playing away. The season had no ups and downs until the COVID-19 pandemic led to its suspension in March 2020. The season came to an end, without relegation and with the promotion of the first two, including the GBC. However, the ACB did not accept those two promotions, so the San Sebastian club had to resort to justice. In this way, on july 31st Gipuzkoa Basket was told by justice that they would play the following season in the highest state competition.

The fact of practically achieving promotion in August seriously harmed the interests of Gipuzkoa Basket, which had to build a squad against the clock and with the resources it had due to the losses caused by the pandemic. The coach, the team's Gipuzkoan block and Johnny Dee were kept, and up to 8 signings were made.

Despite the low quality of the squad, the team began the season with good games, although this illusion would not last long as the team began to lose its arms, achieving only 3 victories in the first round. An improvement early in the second round was not enough for the team to avoid permanence. On May 13, 2021, the relegation in the derby against TD Systems Baskonia was certified, with two games to go before the end of the season.</p>",https://www.naiz.eus/media/asset_publics/resources/000/858/850/article_main_vertical/GBC.jpg.webp,NAIZ,,,,,,GREY
