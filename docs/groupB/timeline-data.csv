1931,,,,,,,,,Guy Callendar discovers that the planet is warming,"In 1938, steam engineer Callendar decided to take a break from his day job and began painstakingly collecting records from 147 weather stations across the world. Doing all his calculations by hand, he discovered that global temperatures had risen 0.3°C over the previous 50 years.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4b/GSCallendar1934.jpg/220px-GSCallendar1934.jpg,,Guy Callendar,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4b/GSCallendar1934.jpg/220px-GSCallendar1934.jpg,jpg,,,
1968,,,,,,,,,Prediction of melting of the ice caps,"In 1968, Dr Mercer was conducting fieldwork at the Reedy Glacier in West Antarctica when he discovered evidence of a former freshwater lake, 1,400 metres high up in the Transantarctic Mountains. In his study, Dr Mercer called the West Antarctic Ice Sheet a 'uniquely vulnerable and unstable body of ice'. He warned that current atmospheric warming could once more cause the ice shelves to disintegrate, causing a sea level rise of about five metres.

The efforts of some concerned scientists sparked the initiative for a global climate program, but it did not achieve the desired success.",https://www.wcrp-climate.org/images/AGU2019/WCC-1-79-plenary2.png,wcrp-climate.org,The beginning of World Climate Conferences in Geneva,https://www.wcrp-climate.org/images/AGU2019/WCC-1-79-plenary2.png,png,,,
1987,9,16,,,,,,,The Montreal Protocol,"The Montreal Protocol is an international treaty adopted on September 16, 1987, in Montreal, Canada. It was introduced to regulate the production and consumption of approximately 100 human-made chemicals that pose a threat to the ozone layer. The protocol, with nearly 200 signatories, is recognized as a model of global cooperation in addressing the issue of ozone depletion. It is the result of extensive scientific study, negotiations among representatives of business and environmental communities, and international consensus on the need to protect the ozone layer.

1988,12,6,,,,,,,The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is set up,"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is an authoritative scientific body operating within the United Nations. Its primary purpose is to deliver a comprehensive and objective assessment of the latest scientific understanding on climate change, including its present condition and the potential environmental and socio-economic consequences it poses. By synthesizing and communicating scientific knowledge, the IPCC plays a vital role in equipping the global community with valuable insights into the challenges and impacts of climate change.

1990,8,,,,,,,,The first IPCC-Report is released,"In its first assessment report the IPCC concludes that humanity's emissions are adding to the atmosphere's natural component of greenhosue gases. It underlines the importance of climate change as a challenge requiring international cooperation to tackle its consequences. The report therefore plays a decisive role in paving the way for the creation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). As of Mai 2023, there are a total of six IPCC-Reports.",https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change_Logo.svg/2560px-Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change_Logo.svg.png,IPCC,The IPCC releases its first report,https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/10/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change_Logo.svg/2560px-Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change_Logo.svg.png,png,,,
1992,5,,,,,,,,Convention on Climate Change is adopted,For the first time binding gas emissions reduction targets are set for industrialised countries. This is due to the text of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) beeing adopted at the UN-Headquarters in New York. This is the key international treaty to reduce global warming and help cope with the consequences of climate change.,https://www.kitano.com/resourcefiles/snippet-main-img/new-york-united-nations-headquarters-top.jpg?version=7152022083758,Kitano,"In the UN-Headquaters in New York, the first important Convention on Climate Change is adopted",https://www.kitano.com/resourcefiles/snippet-main-img/new-york-united-nations-headquarters-top.jpg?version=7152022083758,jpg,,,

Delegates from 117 Parties and 53 observer States came together to assess the commitments made under the 1992 Convention and lay the groundwork for further implementation of its objectives. The conference aimed to address the pressing challenges posed by climate change and foster international cooperation in finding solutions. Parties agree that commitments in the Convention are ""inadequate"" for meeting Convention objectives. They establish a process for negotiating stronger commitments for developed countries, thus laying the groundwork for the Kyoto Protocol.",https://www.blue-growth.org/blue_growth_pictures/COP21_Participants_30_November_2015_Conference_Of_The_Parties_United_Nations.jpg,Climate Action Programme,Group photo at the very first COP,https://www.blue-growth.org/blue_growth_pictures/COP21_Participants_30_November_2015_Conference_Of_The_Parties_United_Nations.jpg,jpg,,,

2005,1,1,,,,,,,The EU's Emissions Trading System is launched,"The European Union implemented its Emission Trading System (ETS) in 2005. The ETS is the world's first and largest carbon market. It sets a cap on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants, industrial facilities, and airlines, allocating emission allowances that can be traded. This market-based approach aims to incentivize emissions reductions by putting a price on carbon. The ETS has since expanded, covering more sectors and fostering innovation in clean technologies, playing a crucial role in the EU's efforts to transition to a low-carbon economy.",https://climatepolicyinfohub.eu/sites/default/files/styles/body_width_520_pix/public/principle-emissions-trading.png%3Fitok=33Z3J2QC,Energy Royd,The fundamentals of the EU's Emissions Trading System (ETS),https://climatepolicyinfohub.eu/sites/default/files/styles/body_width_520_pix/public/principle-emissions-trading.png%3Fitok=33Z3J2QC,png,,,
2007,9,18,,,,,,,The IPCC’s fourth report is released,"The report represents the largest and most detailed summary of the climate change situation ever undertaken, created with the help of thousands of contributors, both scientists and governmental representatives. The headline findings of the report were: ""Warming of the climate system is unequivocal"" and ""Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations.""",https://www.iagua.es/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail-830x455/public/pachauri_cambio_climatico.jpg?itok=KvxZD_K3,IPCC,The fourth IPCC report was a milestone in understanding the impact of Climate Change,https://www.iagua.es/sites/default/files/styles/thumbnail-830x455/public/pachauri_cambio_climatico.jpg?itok=KvxZD_K3,jpg,,,
2016,4,22,,,,,,,Paris Agreeement,"In 2015 the Paris Agreement was created, which replaces the Kyoto Protocol, and is signed by nearly 200 countries, and this time the US signs too.The Paris Agreement is a legally binding international treaty on climate change and its overarching goal is to hold “the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels” and pursue efforts “to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.”
