1843,,,,1843,,,,,The founding of Sociedad Gastronómica ,"<p>The gastronomic tradition of the Basque Country goes beyond five-fork restaurants or sophisticated signature dishes, which are just the spearhead of that deep-rooted 'ritual' that, for the Basques, means preparing a dish and sitting down at the table to enjoy it without haste. This is where the gastronomic societies, or <i>txokos</i>, authentic temples of good food, come into play.</p>
<p>It is precisely in its capital, Donostia-San Sebastián, where the first gastronomic society was born: <i>La Fraternal</i>, founded in 1843. The rise of industrialization and the transfer of population from the countryside to the city led to the emergence of these spaces, which took over from the cider houses in rural areas as meeting places and urban enjoyment around the table.</p>",https://i.blogs.es/7aa515/almuerzo-de-inauguracion-de-la-sociedad-aitzaki.-ano-1932/450_1000.jpg,,,,,,,
1948,,,,1948,,,,,Gildas: the little-known origin of the most popular banderilla in Spain,"<p>A bar in San Sebastián, Vallés, is attributed, apparently with good reason, to the creation in 1948 of the Gildas: olives, chilli peppers and anchovies, a typical basque <i>pintxo</i> and the one that started it all. They are the most popular <i>banderillas</i> in Spain, especially in the Basque Country, where they have become an icon.</p>
<p>This bar, located behind the Buen Pastor Cathedral, was at that time a wine office where Blas Vallés sold those that he himself made in Navarra. To accompany those wines, customers were offered olives, chilli peppers, and anchovies. <b>But all separately</b>. One day a customer had the idea of ​​pricking all three together on a toothpick. The skewer was already created as it has come to this day.</p>",https://s3.abcstatics.com/media/viajar/2019/11/05/gilda-valles-kUeE--1248x698@abc.JPG,,,,,,,
1914,,,,1914,,,,,Belle Époque,"<p>In the 1930s, at the height of the <i>“belle époque”</i>, Donostia-San Sebastián was one of the favourite holiday destinations for the international aristocracy. A fashionable and cosmopolitan city. Its proximity to Biarritz, being a spa town, having a railway and being a summer resort for different royal families (and their numerous entourages and companions), gave the city of Donostia a very special attraction, which led to better development of the gastronomy inside the city as an additional touristic attraction.</p>",https://www.xlsemanal.com/conocer/20161028/la-belle-epoque-san-sebastian.html,,,,,,,

1972,,,,1972,,,,,The first michelin star in Donostia for Juan Mari Arzak,"</p>A short time later, together with a group of restless Basque professionals and encouraged by their French colleagues, they formed a block that promoted the revival of Basque cuisine to modernize it and bring it on par with modern European cuisine, which was called the movement ""New Basque Cuisine”.</p>

<p>The New Basque Cuisine is a culinary current that began in 1976 in Gipuzkoa (Spain) which, inspired by some of the principles of French <i>Nouvelle Cuisine</i>, brought about a renewal of traditional Basque cuisine based on three principles: the recovery of traditional recipes and dishes lost; the recovery of the authenticity of the ingredients through market cuisine and the use of seasonal products; and the expansion of the traditional recipe book through creativity and innovation.​</p>

<p>This trend initiated by a group of young chefs, mostly from Gipuzkoa, headed by Juan Mari Arzak and Pedro Subijana, was in turn the starting point for a renewal of Spanish gastronomy that, over time, has positioned it as one of the world benchmarks</p>",https://i0.wp.com/observaciongastronomica.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/arzak-en-vitoria-92.jpg?resize=452%2C306&ssl=1,,,,,,,
