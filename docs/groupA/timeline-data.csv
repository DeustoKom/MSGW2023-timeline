1843,,,,1843,,,,,The founding of Sociedad Gastronómica ,"The gastronomic tradition of the Basque Country goes beyond five-fork restaurants or sophisticated signature dishes, which are just the spearhead of that deep-rooted 'ritual' that, for the Basques, means preparing a dish and sitting down at the table to enjoy it without haste. This is where the gastronomic societies, or 'txokos', authentic temples of good food, come into play.
It is precisely in its capital, Donostia-San Sebastián, where the first gastronomic society was born: 'La Fraternal', founded in 1843. The rise of industrialization and the transfer of population from the countryside to the city led to the emergence of these spaces, which took over from the cider houses in rural areas as meeting places and urban enjoyment around the table.","http://www.sociedadesgastronomicas.com/articulo.php?id=11 https://www.bizkaiatalent.eus/pais-vasco-te-espera/senas-de-identidad/sociedades-gastronomicas-templos/#:~:text=Es%20precisamente%20en%20su%20capital,Fraternal'%2C%20fundada%20en%201843.

1948,,,,,,,,,Gildas: the little-known origin of the most popular banderilla in Spain,"A bar in San Sebastián, Vallés, is attributed, apparently with good reason, the creation in 1948 of the Gildas: olives, chilli peppers and anchovies, a typical basque pintxo and the one that started it all. They are the most popular banderillas in Spain, especially in the Basque Country, where they have become an icon.
This bar, located behind the Buen Pastor Cathedral, was at that time a wine office where Blas Vallés sold those that he himself made in Navarra. To accompany those wines, customers were offered olives, chilli peppers, and anchovies. But all separately. One day a customer had the idea of ​​pricking the three things on a toothpick. The skewer was already created as it has come to this day.","https://www.abc.es/viajar/gastronomia/abci-gildas-origen-poco-conocido-banderilla-mas-popular-espana-201911050300_noticia.html#:~:text=Un%20bar%20de%20San%20Sebasti%C3%A1n,gildas%3A%20aceitunas%2C%20guindillas%20y%20anchoas&text=05%2F11%2F2019%20a%20las%2003%3A00h.&text=Son%20las%20banderillas%20m%C3%A1s%20populares,convertido%20en%20todo%20un%20icono.",,,,,,,

The New Basque Cuisine is a culinary current that began in 1976 in Guipúzcoa (Spain) which, inspired by some of the principles of French Nouvelle Cuisine, brought about a renewal of traditional Basque cuisine based on three principles: the recovery of traditional recipes and dishes lost; the recovery of the authenticity of the ingredients through market cuisine and the use of seasonal products; and the expansion of the traditional recipe book through creativity and innovation.1​2​
